# Lazarus

**Lazarus** is one player game and the player has to help Lazarus to escape from its abductor. Lazarus can move and jump to the left and right. There are four types of boxes and these boxes differ in strength: metal, stone, wood, and cardboard in descending order. If the stronger box falls on the top of the lighter one, the lighter box disappears.
The Lazarus creates the stairs by using the falling boxes. If the Lazarus reaches to the stop sign, the next level is rendered.
The game has two levels and each level has a different map and difficulty. The Lazarus dies if a box falls on top of it.
